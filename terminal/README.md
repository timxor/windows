To define an alias named "clear" in Windows Command Prompt for the "cls" command, you can create a batch script and add it to a directory included in the system's PATH variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a text editor such as Notepad.
2. Type the following command in the text editor:

```batch
@echo off
cls
```

This script simply runs the "cls" command when executed.

3. Save the file with a `.bat` extension, such as `clear.bat`. Make sure to save it in a directory that is included in your system's PATH variable. For example, you can save it in the `C:\Windows` directory.

4. Open Command Prompt.

Now, when you type "clear" in the Command Prompt, it will execute the batch script and clear the screen using the "cls" command.

Note: If you have an existing executable or command named "clear" in one of the directories listed in the PATH variable, it will take precedence over the batch script. In that case, you may need to rename the existing executable or command, or choose a different name for your alias.
